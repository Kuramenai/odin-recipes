            <li>Place cubed potatoes and garlic in a large pot with enough water to cover.

            <li>Brown ground beef over medium heat in a skillet.

            <li>Transfer beef mixture into an oven-proof casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Drain potatoes and smash them a little bit before adding 1/4 cup of grated cheese and sour cream.

            <li>Spoon potatoes onto the middle of the meat mixture. 
                With a fork, spread potatoes from the center to the edges to form the top layer.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden.
